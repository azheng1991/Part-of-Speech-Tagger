# Part-of-Speech-Tagger

Introduction
In this notebook, you'll use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

High level project description: 
•Utilized hidden Markov model to tag a universal data set
•Built a most frequent class tagger in Python as baseline
•Compared the HMM model to baseline to ensure accuracy of results (over 95% accuracy)
